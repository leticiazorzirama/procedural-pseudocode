# Procedural Pseudocode  
This repository contains solutions to problems from WebAlgo, a development environment for algorithms that uses **procedural** pseudocode.  
The goal is to enhance *programming logic* and *mathematical reasoning skills*.

## 📂 Repository Structure    
The files are organized into the following algorithm categories:  
- **Sequential (S)**: step-by-step instructions.  
- **Conditional (C)**: decisions based on conditions.  
- **Iterative (I)**: loops and repetition structures.  
- **Array (V)**: working with arrays.  
- **Matrix (M)**: working with matrices.  
- **Function (F)**: function creation and usage.  
- **Recursion (R)**: implementing recursive calls.

## 🚀 How to Use  
Each algorithm is saved in a .txt file, containing an identifier, the problem description, and the corresponding solution.  
The algorithms can be executed in WebAlgo, which is stored in the tools-webalgo folder in this repository. Alternatively, you can simply view the .txt files.  
WebAlgo requires JDK 16 to run. You can download it here: [Oracle JDK 16](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html).

## 📌 Notes  
The pseudocode follows a syntax similar to Portugol.  
This repository is intended for learning and practicing *programming logic* and *mathematical reasoning*.
